# CreditCard FraudDetection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using an autoencoder neural network. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct normal transactions, and transactions that deviate significantly from the reconstruction are noted as potential fraud. Additionally, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are used for data augmentation to address the class imbalance in the dataset.
